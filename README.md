# TictactoeJS
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game includes playing aginst the computer in three difficulty levels (easy, medium, and hard) and the game logic is implemented using the minimax algorithm to determine the computer's moves.


## Difficulty Levels
The levels are:
  - Easy: The computer makes random moves.
  - Medium: The computer uses the minimax algorithm to determine its moves, but only looks ahead a few moves.
  - Hard: The computer uses the minimax algorithm to determine its moves, and looks ahead many moves to find the best move.


## Game Logic
The logic is implemented using the minimax algorithm, which is a recursive algorithm that is used to determine the best move for the computer. The algorithm works by evaluating all possible moves that can be made by the computer and the player, and then choosing the move that leads to the best outcome for the computer.
